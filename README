This is example code of how to get Google Talk notifications when a web page is hit.  
The example script handles webhook notifications from BeanstalkApp.

This project requires the XMPPHP project. It's been archived. 
So the link to the latest and greatest will probably always be:
https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/xmpphp/xmpphp-0.1rc2-r77.tgz

Extract the contents of that archive and move the directory named XMPPHP to location where this 
file will live on your webserver.  

If you ssh/putty to your server and change to the directory where this file will live, you can 
just paste these into your terminal window to complete this process:

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/xmpphp/xmpphp-0.1rc2-r77.tgz
tar -xzf xmpphp-0.1rc2-r77.tgz
mv xmpphp-0.1rc2-r77/XMPPHP .
rm -rf xmpphp-0.1rc2-r77
rm -f xmpphp-0.1rc2-r77.tgz

You will then also need to change the constants in the php file.  
If you're using this as a BeanstalkApp deployment notification tool, log into beanstalk 
and then set the post deployment notification for your project. The script can be used 
for multiple projects. No alteration is required.

IMPORTANT!  This script requires TCP port 5222 to be open outbund on your server.
If this port is closed you will get "Could not connect before time out" errors.

IMPORTANT!  Google Talk works off of invites.  So you MUST have chatting between source and 
destination working before you use this script.
